# CPL (Concepts of Programming Languages)

This project is to build an interpreter using scala.

Credit to Mahmoud & Omar helping out with building last weeks parser and 
together we managed to have the best test combination.
As a result a lot of tests can also be found on their own repo with no differences.

Also most of the parsers have a lot in common since we worked together to get
things work on IntelliJ to proceed faster.

To run this project:
- You need to have scala on your machine
- Import the project using IntelliJ 
- IntelliJ have set everything up for you, Have fun!

The design of a programming language is the result of a selection from a general collection of programming language concepts. With some frequency, new languages are introduced that combine concepts in an novel manner and sometimes introduce new concepts. During his/her career, a computer scientist will have to work with more than one generation of programming languages. In order to learn new programming languages, a computer scientist should understand the basic principles in the design of programming languages.
